<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it's very funny and leaves a nice message.</p>

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>The best animated Halloween movie, I love the song and how it was made.</p>

<h3>Just Go With It</h3>
<p>
  It's one of my favorite romantic comedy movies because it combine love, humor
  and a little bit of chaos.
